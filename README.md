Linear Algebra Shell
====================

An shell-based utility for solving various linear/matrix algebra formulas, written in C++ with minimal library dependencies.
Currently relies only on <string> and <iostream>.

Currently supported features:
 - Solving traces and determinants of matrices
 - Performing elementary row operations on matrices
 
Planned features to add (in no particular order):
 - Automatic row reduction
 - Computation of eigenvalues, vectors, and spaces
 - Matrix multiplication
 - Matrix inversion
 - Support for matrices of types other than int
 - Solving for bases of row, column, and null spaces of matrices

Any support would be appreciated, especially a revision of the input function, to allow for the parsing of more than just 1 digit positive ints for matrix values.
